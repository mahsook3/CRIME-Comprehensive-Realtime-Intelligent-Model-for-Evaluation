Cyber Attack/ Dependent Crimes,SQL Injection,"The issue actually started when I got this email, which at first glance seemed like spam. I usually ignore such things, but for some reason, I opened it this time. Afterward, my phone started freezing, and it wasnâ€™t normal. I thought it was a technical glitch, but now Iâ€™m not so sure. I don't know how, but itâ€™s like they knew everything I was doing, even though I was trying to be careful. Itâ€™s terrifying to think about. The more I tried to fix it, the more problems came up. My work account was hackd, and then I got locked out of everything. This has really left me anxious and frustrated, I canâ€™t sleep knowing my information is out there. Iâ€™ve even considered deleting all my accounts, but thatâ€™s not a solution. Even my phone isnâ€™t working right anymore. Itâ€™s so stange how everything just fell apart after that one email."
